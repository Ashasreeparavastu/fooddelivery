For fetching images and data I have used Json parsing using Volley Library. I have used Glide Library for displaying images in proper indentation and pixels. This app uses Facebook SDK for login purpose and a proper login Authentication using Firebase Authentication. This application provides a nice and comfortable GUI for the users to operate.
